                    So I wanted to take some time and make sure I had the opportunity to say a special Thank You!
                    I wanted to make sure I showed my graditude to the devCodeCamp team and the Instructors. I never
                    thought I would be able to look back and say to myself, "You did that! You did THIS!!"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I started this journey because I wanted to provide a better life for my 3 daughters after their mother had passed away
                    from Stage 4 Breast and Liver Metastatic Cancer this past year. I wouldnt be here today if it wasnt for the example
                    given to me by my late wife. She fought every second to be here for her daughters and that inspires me to be better
                    for them!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I want to shout out my team who I worked with on our group projects, TEAM MVP!!! Ive learned so much about myself
                    and I'm honored I got the chance to get to know every student and team member in the devCodeCamp course!
                    Good luck to everyone and I'm so excited to see what you all accomplish moving forward!
